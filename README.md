# Creating-a-Docker-Container-Image-and-Pushing-it-to-AWS-Elastic-Container-Registry-ECR-
In this project, I developed a Docker container image and successfully pushed it to a private AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR). This involved two key phases:
*Phase 1: Creating and Testing the Docker Image*
- Launched an Amazon EC2 instance with Docker installed.
- Created a Dockerfile using Ubuntu 18.04, installed Apache, and set up a simple web server to display a custom message.
- Built and ran the Docker image, ensuring it functioned as expected.

*Phase 2: Pushing the Image to AWS ECR*
- Created a private repository in AWS ECR.
- Authenticated the Docker client with AWS ECR and tagged the Docker image.
- Pushed the image to the ECR repository and verified its successful upload.

This project demonstrated my proficiency with Docker, Amazon EC2, and AWS ECR, highlighting my ability to manage containerized applications within a cloud environment.
